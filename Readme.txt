 you have to do is type make and it will make a executable named city1

w is to go forward 
a is to rotate left
s is to go backwards
d if to rotate right
e is to look up
c is to look down

There should be a city full of textures a big building a long building and 2 house/warehouses
there is 1 car but it does not move by the bezier curve it uses a timed function that moves the whole thing forward right back then resets back to normal
The camera on the car I scrapped because It was not working for me.


 Please Credit me if you end up using this project
